🚀 Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset. Fraud detection is a critical task for financial institutions to protect customers and reduce financial loss. The model analyzes transaction patterns to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains:
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
Details:
Total transactions: 284,807
Fraudulent transactions: 492 (~0.17% of the data)
Features:
28 anonymized numerical features (PCA-transformed).
Time: Seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction.
Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.
Class: Binary label (1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Legitimate).

⚙️ Project Objectives
Preprocess and clean the dataset.
Handle the class imbalance using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
Train and evaluate machine learning models for classification.
Provide insights into model performance and fraud detection metrics.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📈 Model Evaluation
Key metrics to evaluate the model:
Accuracy: Overall performance.

📌 Future Enhancements
Experiment with deep learning models like Autoencoders or LSTMs.
Explore real-time fraud detection pipelines.
Improve interpretability using SHAP or LIME.
